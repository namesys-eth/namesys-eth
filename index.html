      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
        Names are not important. To speak is to name names, but to speak is not
        important. A thing happens once that has never happened before. Seeing
        it, a man looks upon reality. He cannot tell others what he has seen.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
        Others wish to know, however, so they question him saying, 'What is it
        like, this thing you have seen?' So he tries to tell them. Perhaps he
        has seen the very first fire in the world. He tells them, 'It is red,
        like a poppy, but through it dance other colors. It has no form, like
        water, flowing everywhere. It is warm, like the sun of summer, only
        warmer. It exists for a time upon a piece of wood, and then the wood is
        gone, as though it were eaten, leaving behind that which is black and
        can be sifted like sand. When the wood is gone, it too is gone.'
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
        Therefore, the hearers must think reality is like a poppy, like water,
        like the sun, like that which eats and excretes. They think it is like
        to anything that they are told it is like by the man who has known it.
        But they have not looked upon fire. They cannot really know it. They can
        only know of it. But fire comes again into the world, many times. More
        men look upon fire. After a time, fire is as common as grass and clouds
        and the air they breathe. They see that, while it is like a poppy, it is
        not a poppy, while it is like water, it is not water, while it is like
        the sun, it is not the sun, and while it is like that which eats and
        passes wastes, it is not that which eats and passes wastes, but
        something different from each of these apart or all of these together.
        So they look upon this new thing and they make a new word to call it.
        They call it 'fire.'
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
        If they come upon one who still has not seen it and they speak to him of
        fire, he does not know what they mean. So they, in turn, fall back upon
        telling him what fire is like. As they do so, they know from their own
        experience that what they are telling him is not the truth, but only
        part of it. They know that this man will never know reality from their
        words, though all the words in the world are theirs to use. He must look
        upon the fire, smell of it, warm his hands by it, stare into its heart,
        or remain forever ignorant.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
        Therefore, 'fire' does not matter, 'earth' and 'air' and 'water' do not
        matter. 'I' do not matter. No word matter. But man forgets reality and
        remembers words. The more words he remembers, the cleverer do his
        fellows esteem him. He looks upon the great transformations of the
        world, but he does not see them as they were seen when man looked upon
        reality for the first time. Their names come to his lips and he smiles
        as he tastes them, thinking he knows them in the naming.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
        The thing that has never happened before is still happening. It is still
        a miracle. The great burning blossom squats, flowing, upon the limb of
        the world, excreting the ash of the world, and being none of these
        things I have named and at the same time all of them, and this is
        reality-the Nameless."
